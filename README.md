# Job training project

### Machine Learning and Causal Inference. MSc in Data Science Methodology. Barcelona School of Economics.

Project idea borrowed from the book by Imbens and Rubin (2015).

## Description

In this project you should attempt to conduct a causal analysis of
data collected by the study of Lalonde (1986), where they compare
the effect on trainee earnings of an employment program that was
run as a field experiment where participants were randomly assigned
to treatment and control groups. These data are used throughout the
book of Imbens and Rubin (2015) and there you will find comprehensive
explanations about these data, as well as ideas to analyse it from a
causal perspective. One of the possible causal questions to answer is
whether the training program had an effect in earnings.

## Deliverables

You should write your analysis in an R Markdown or Python notebook, interwining
text and code to facilitate the understanding of the analysis steps and their
reproducibility. You should include the HTML output file of that notebook, along
with all the files involved in the analysis. The HTML output should show at the
top a front matter including the title of the project, the names of the authors
and the date. Failing in any of these formal aspects will penalize the grade.

## Submission procedure

This project has to be submitted using
[GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com). This
means that you should have cloned the GitHub repo of this project
from the organization account for MLCI in the corresponding academic
year at https://github.com/MLCIXXXX using the submission link
provided through Google Classroom.

Once you have cloned this GitHub repo, then you can work on it in
your local disk and _push_ your changes whenever you like, but make
sure that you have pushed the last version of your assignment before
the deadline; consult the Google Classroom if you are unsure about
the deadline. There is no _submit_ button or any other specific
submission procedure or action than just pushing your changes to your
GitHub assignment repo. When correcting the assignment, the version
available at the deadline will be retrieved. If the last update to
the repo is posterior to the deadline, then the mark of the
assignment will have a penalty.
